<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Console Example Output](images/console_output.png)

  This bash program helps to migrate or deploy git projects with many submodules from a private area (like a LAN), to a public area (like github).

  I made it because I had exactly that situation: having a local git server AND a public one. When I wanted to migrate some Projects (and they had many submodules) the issue was always doing the exactly steps over and over again:

1. cloning the project from the private repo
2. changing the .gitmodules file and changing each url to the "new remote"
3. changing the .git/conf file and changing each url to the "new remote"
4. deleting the modules from .git/modules and /modules
5. adding remote and push each submodule
6. adding remote and push "root" git repo

Also it was a mess doing that steps over and over and then realising it's a faulty url...

So I made this project.

### Funfact - Trivia

I also tried some test concepts I learned in university for testcoverage. It was also an ..let's say experience writing unit test in and for bash oO.

Have a look on [Test Coverage](https://github.com/Blackstareye/deep_copy_submodules_test/blob/cc6e981a8a8f977e83afe5fcea58bae45756e76f/testcoverage.md)
  
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

1. clone the repo
2. have a look on the config.conf (see [config](config.conf))
3. cd to the cloned repo and run `install.sh`:
   1. > `cd <cloned_repo>`
   2. >`bash install.sh`
4. run the program
   1. > `bash deep_copy_submodules.sh "remote" "<private_url>" "<public_url>"`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

```bash
# try deep deep_copy_submodules.sh --usuage for usuage information
deep deep_copy_submodules.sh --usuage

# remote private repo
bash deep_copy_submodules.sh "remote" "https://privatefoo.bar" "https://public_foo.bar"
# ssh private repo
bash deep_copy_submodules.sh "ssh" "git@git-server" "https://public_foo.bar"
# local private repo
bash deep_copy_submodules.sh "local" "/foo/bar/git_repo" "<public_url>"

```

### Parameter

* --help  Shows the help for that script
* --usuage Shows the usuage for that script
* -v Enables Validation if it is in config not set
* -t Enables Testing_Connections if it is in config not set

**Validation:** The Connection can be checked before they will be progressed with this flag. This will enable syntax checking of the given urls and parameters. If also **Testing Connections** is enabled, the connections will also be checked with curl.

**Testing Connections:** Connections can be checked before they will be progressed with this flag. A curl request will be used for checking

**WARNING:** If validation is turned off, the urls will be used as they are with no further checking. use this with caution or if you know what you do.


### Config

The Config explanation is added directly to the given config parameter.
see: [config](config.conf)

### IMPORTANT NOTES

* SSH can only be used for the first repo not for the uploading target repo
* Git-Submodules can only be parsed if they don't contain a '-' "dash" in the folder and or module name
  * this relies on the fact, that I parse the sections of the .gitmodules ini into dynamic variables like
    * `$configuration_submodule[key]=value`

### Known Issues

Unfortunately projects with git lfs do not work on the sytems I use it. So I can't guarantee if it will work. But this is the first issue I will hunt down and fix.
